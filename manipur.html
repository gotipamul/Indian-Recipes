Kangsoi is the anipuri answer to stew.<br>
As humble as it is, it is a healthy and good food for the body 
and soul (almost like chicken soup!).<br>

<h2><font color="red">Ingredients:</font></h2>

•	1 medium potato – cut into roundels<br>
•	1 medium size tomato -de-seeded and sliced into chunks<br>
•	About 15-20 French beans – de-stringed and snapped<br>
•	1 small onion – sliced<br>
•	1 small zucchini – peeled and sliced<br>
•	1 carrot – peeled and sliced<br>
•	1 cup peas (if available, use whole peas i.e. with the 
	shells on)<br>
•	2 medium sized ngari – steamed or roasted<br>
•	3-4 dried red chillies – soaked in hot water till soft<br>
•	1 cm ginger – sliced<br>
•	Salt to taste<br>
•	Nga ayaiba (smoked fish) – optional<br>
<h2><font color="red">Preparation:</font></h2>

Mash the ngari with the red chillies and keep aside.<br> 
(This is my husband’s technique. He cookskangsoi better than me.<br>
 i go for the easy way out – i.e. put in the ngari and red 
chillies in thekangsoi and let the boiling water take care of 
the job.<br> 
Just this once, i did it his way!).<br>
In a saucepan, bring about 3 cups of water to a boil.<br>
 Add the sliced onion and ginger and cover and cook till onion is 
softened. Add the vegetables.<br>
 Season with salt.<br> 
Add the smoked fish and the mashed ngari.<br> 
Cover and simmer till the vegetables are cooked.<br> 
Easy peasy.<br>
Enjoy with steamed rice and omelette<br> 
(my favourite combination) or with yen angouba (fried chicken).<br><hr>

<h2><font color="red">Ingredients:</font></h2>
•	1 medium potato, peeled and cubed<br>
•	1/2 onion, thinly sliced<br>
•	1/2 teaspoon coriander powder<br>
•	1/2 teaspoon cumin powder<br>
•	Salt<br>
•	Turmeric (1 teaspoon should do, i guess.
	 But feel free to add more or less)<br>
•	Chilli powder (as per your taste)<br>
•	Oil<br>
•	3-4 steak/piece of fried fish<br> (any variety will 
	do but catfish or ngakra goes best with soibum.
	 i used katla)<br>
<h2><font color="red">Preparation:</font></h2>

If you are using the ‘real’ soibum,<br>
 you would need to soak it in salt water and wash it properly<br>
 to remove the tartness.<br>
 If you are using the canned variety which is milder,<br>
 just wash it in running water and you are good to go.<br>
Heat some oil in a wok. <br>
When hot, put in the sliced onion<br>
 (i don’t like ginger and garlic except in fish or meat 
dishes but you can add them if you like).<br>
 Fry till translucent. Add the turmeric, chilli,
 coriander and cumin powder and fry for some time.<br>
 Add the potato and the bamboo shoots. Fry till the shoots get limp.<br>
 Add the desired quantity of water and season with salt. <br>
Add the fried fish.<br>
 Cover and simmer till everything is cooked.<br>
Serve with steamed rice.<br>

<h2><font color="red">Ingredients:</font></h2>
1 cup rice (arua chaula)<br>
1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)<br>
2 bay leaves (teja patra)<br>
4 cloves garlic (rasuna)<br>
1 inch ginger (ada)<br>
1 teaspoon sesame seeds (raashi)<br>
1 teaspoon turmeric powder (haladi gunda)<br>
1 cup refined cooking oil (rifaain tela)<br>
salt to taste (luna)<br>
Vegetables to be used (any, some or all):<br>
plantain (kancha kadali)<br>
yam (mati alu)<br>
brinjal (baigana)<br>
pumpkin (kakharu)<br>
raw papaya (kancha amrutabhanda)<br>
lotus stems (padma nada)<br>
potato (aalu)<br>
(some other vegetables may also be used) <br>
<font color="red">Method:</font><br>
First of all soak rice in water for one hour.<br>
Make a paste of the soaked rice, cumin seeds, bay leaves, <br>
garlic and ginger by adding a little water in a grinder.<br>
Grind it to a coarse paste till it gains consistency like the<br> 
dosa batter. Shift the paste into a container and add turmeric<br> 
powder, sesame seeds and salt and mix well. <br>
Keep it aside. Now wash the vegetables and cut them into thin<br> 
slices. Take a kadai / pan and add the vegetables into a quantity<br>
water that would completely soak all the vegetables.<br> 
Add turmeric powder. Now turn the flame on and start boiling
the vegetables.<br> 
Add salt to taste.<br> 
Keep in mind that you have to add a little more salt<br> 
since the water would have to be drained out later.<br> 
Allow it to boil for about 5 minutes. <br>
Remember that we are here para boiling rather than completely <br>
boiling the vegetables. Make sure that the vegetables are not over
cooked.<br>
 (You can directly use brinjal and pumpkin without para boiling,<br>
 since they are soft vegetables.) Now strain the vegetables and 
drain out water.<br> 
Then heat the tawa on medium flame and pour a generous quantity<br>
 of oil so that oil is spread all over the tawa.<br>
 Now soak the para boiled vegetables one by one in the rice batter<br>
 and place them on the tawa. You can cover the whole tawa with 
vegetable slices.<br> 
After one minute turn each slice upside down and fry. <br>
If a little bit more oil is required, add the same and allow all 
the slices to be fried well on both sides till they turn crisp.<br> 
Then serve hot with rice and dal.<br>
This kind of dry fried vegetables in rice paste is quite popular 
in Orissa.<br> 
It is a quick recipe that uses lesser oil.<br> 
You can also make the rice paste and keep it in refrigerator for 
immediate use any time.<br>
